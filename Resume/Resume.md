## Summary
A problem solver and challenge seeker to the core, I am a goal oriented and resourceful individual who is often 
appreciated for having the ability to work independently with minimal oversight, and who consistently delivers as 
promised.

## Volunteer Experience

### **Volunteer Diver**
**Rrreefs**  
*August 2022 - September 2022*

Participated in a coral reef restoration workshop hosted by Phanor Montoya-Maya, Corales de Paz - Buceo con Propósito, and the rrreefs team. Learned about the plight of coral reefs, modern restoration practices, and the direction the field is moving towards. Gained hands-on experience in maintaining coral nurseries, micro-fragmentation, and coral out planting.

### **ROV Video and Photographer Assistant**
**National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)**  
*June 2015 - July 2015*

NOAA's R/V Manta was conducting an environmental survey on an out of commission oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico near the east Flower Garden Banks. The mission was to conduct a biological survey on the rig's structure to identify biological diversity.
